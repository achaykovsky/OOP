# OOP Python Exercises for Interview Preparation

Welcome to the **OOP Python Exercises for Interview Preparation** repository! This collection is designed to help you sharpen your Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills in Python, with exercises commonly encountered in technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each **exercise** has its own directory.
- Within each exercise directory:
  - Each **class** is implemented in a separate Python file.
  - Additional helper functions or utilities, if any, are placed in appropriately named files.
  - An optional `README.md` file may be included to explain the specific problem and provide usage examples.

## Getting Started

To begin working with the exercises:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/achaykovsky/OOP.git
    cd OOP
    ```

2. **Navigate to an exercise directory**:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/exercise-directory
    ```

3. **Run the exercise**:
    Each exercise comes with a main file `main.py` that you can run to see the OOP principles in action.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
